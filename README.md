# Floydicus Old Pack
Hello people, in 2019 I started a private resource pack which had the goal of reproducing Minecraft Beta as much as possible. Using classic textures, custom models, blockstates and everything in between. After working on it for nearly a year with feedback from several people, I've decided to make this public to everyone to enjoy.

The resource pack is being developed for both 1.13+ and 1.12.2 versions (not very complete still). The packs for each version are under <code>src/</code>

* Planet Minecraft page [here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/floydicus-old-pack/).
